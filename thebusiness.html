        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Wandering Chef is a food truck business which addresses the common problems of existing food truck businesses, namely the limited choice of menu and the lack 
          of the option for customers to participate in the food selection process. With a fully equipped kitchen and a generator for self-powering capabilities, The Wandering 
          Chef offers customers the unique business model of providing our professional chefs with personally sourced ingredients. Our chefs then create meals based on the 
          provided ingredients and the customers' cuisine preferences.</p>
        <p>Besides the food truck hire, The Wandering Chef also offers customers a custom meal prep service. A monthly subscription entitles customers to a complete service, 
          from purchasing requested groceries to delivering meals to their homes.</p>
